# Transifex Engineering Manifesto (TEM)

Documentation offering insights on how Engineering works in Transifex. It was created in order to help everyone in the team do things more efficiently. Its ultimate purpose is to help us raise the quality of our codebase and processes and, as a result, the quality of our product.

It provides guidelines, best practices and processes that span across various areas of the everyday workflow of an engineer in our team.

This is the output of an ongoing process. Expect this document to be extended, modified and otherwise improved in the future, as we all grow, mature and optimize the way we work.
