# Meeting guide

Purpose of this guide is to present a policy that will help optimize meetings.

## Preparing the meeting

The **inviter** should be able to answer the question *“What <invitee> has to offer in this meeting?”*

The **inviter** should always send a **calendar** invitation, inviting people that should attend.

The invitation should appoint the **facilitator** who will orchestrate the meeting.

The invitation should describe an **agenda** and an expected **outcome**.

**Invitees** are free to question their presence based on the proposed agenda.

**Invitees** should feel free to **inform** the inviter and **reject** any invitation that does not satisfy these **criteria**.

## During the meeting

The facilitator should be making sure that everybody in the meeting gets equal opportunity to speak, especially remote attendees. [1]

The facilitator should be keeping **notes**.

The facilitator should be making sure that the meeting is not getting off topic and the **agenda** is followed.

The facilitator should be following a specific **timeframe** for each topic.

The facilitator should be keeping the meeting in the reserved **timebox**.

The facilitator is **responsible** for the conclusion or next action of each topic, reducing the risk of endless discussions without solid conclusions.

## After the meeting

The facilitator should upload the notes in Google Drive.

Recurring meeting notes can be appended on the same file in Google Drive.

One-off meeting notes should be added in a separate file using the following document name:

`<year>.<month>.<day> <meeting name/description>`

For example: *“2018.01.05 Q1 Engineering OKRs”*

[1] For example they may coordinate speaking turns by asking attendees to raise their hands before they speak.
